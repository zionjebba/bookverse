',content:` The Water-Babies was first published in Macmillan’s Magazine on
 a monthly basis from August 1862 to March 1863. Kingsley
 made several minor revisions and added substantial material for
 the story’s appearance in book form in 1863.This text apparently
 has the authority of Kingsley’s final approval, since subsequent
 editions show no significant revisions. The Broadview edition,
 therefore, follows the 1863 edition, published by Macmillan, and
 includes the “L’Envoi,” which was removed during the press run
 (“lest it should be misunderstood and give needless offence,”
 possibly to Thomas Henry Huxley and Bishop Wilberforce).
 Kingsley’s unusual spellings have been retained from this edition.
 The first edition featured two illustrations by the distinguished
 Scottish painter Joseph Noel Paton (1821-1901), now best
 remembered for his fairy paintings, such as the “Quarrel of
 Oberon and Titania.” In 1886 Macmillan published a plush
 edition in blue cloth gilt with 100 wood engravings after drawings
 by Linley Sambourne. This illustrated edition became the stan
dard for the various versions Macmillan produced thereafter.
 Several artists began to illustrate the book after it came out of
 copyright in 1906. Perhaps the best known of these artists is
 Jessie Willcox Smith (1863-1935), an American illustrator who
 had studied under Howard Pyle. Her twelve lavish drawings
 appeared in Dodd and Mead’s publication of The Water-Babies in
 1916 and now reside in the Library of Congress. Her work is color
ful, charming, sweet, romantic, sentimental, and a delight to view.
 Her drawings, however, are more suited to an abridgement of the
 story (and there were many such) that simply sets forth the nar
rative fantasy. But Kingsley laces his narrative with numerous dis
cussions of all manner of topics, from contemporary theories of
 evolution to the ideas of ancient philosophers and scientists.
 Smith’s illustrations fail to accommodate these breathless leaps
 into abstraction.
 Sambourne, on the other hand, came well prepared to the
 task. Born and educated in London, he became a draughtsman
 in a firm of marine engineers in Greenwich. In 1871 he joined
 the staff of Punch, where he became its chief political cartoonist.
 His work there was characterized by surreal comedy, remarkable
 accuracy in detail, and consummate draftsmanship. He owned a
 library of 100,000 photographs that he used as the models for his
 series “Mr. Punch’s Portraits.” It is his meticulous care for detail
 THEWATER-BABIES 37
Review Copy
 and his decorative-grotesque imagery that make his style suited
 to Kingsley’s story. Better than anyone, he was able to capture
 Kingsley’s satire, as in his drawing of Richard Owen and Thomas
 Henry Huxley examining a bottled water-baby. Avoiding the sen
timental, he creates a visual atmosphere of the grotesque: the
 skull of a ram picked clean by crows, a terrifying lobster rising out
 of the waves, a gorilla and otter snarling and viciously showing
 their teeth, Tom with his body covered in horrid prickles, and a
 nightmarish eft lying on its back. Sambourne thus creates a Dar
winian world, where one’s survival is always at risk and where this
 reality is rendered in exquisite, frightening detail.
 Tom, who appears distressed, brooding at times, and some
what ugly, is a far cry from the cherubic Tom drawn by most of
 the other illustrators.
 It should be noted that Sambourne presents the initial letter
 of the opening sentence of each chapter within his illustration.
 Graphic initial letters have a long tradition that goes back to the
 days of illuminated medieval manuscripts. Sambourne’s initial
 letters, however, are sometime difficult to discern, so closely are
 they woven into the fabric of the illustration. In Chapter 2, for
 example, the branches covering the roof of the house form the
 letter “A.” In Chapter 3, the tail of the mermaid is in the shape
 of the letter “T.” In Chapter 6 the letter “H” appears demurely
 on the drum. It is only in Chapter 4 that Sambourne’s imagina
tion fails him, and he simply places the “S” and “O” on each of
 the boat’s sails.
 The Broadview edition thus combines the Sambourne illus
trations from Macmillan’s 1886 edition with the first edition of
 the text published by Macmillan in 1863. The two decorative
 illustrations by Paton that appeared in the first edition may be
 seen in the Appendix I`},

  Atomic Habits" by James Clear is a captivating self-help book that delves into the profound impact of small habits and the underlying science that governs habit formation. Clear's central thesis revolves around the concept of "atomic habits," which are tiny changes that, when consistently practiced, lead to remarkable transformations over time. He argues that the key to achieving lasting change lies not in dramatic overhauls, but rather in the consistent implementation of these small, incremental improvements.
      </p>
      <p>
      Clear structures the book around four fundamental principles of habit formation: cue, craving, response, and reward. The cue serves as the trigger that initiates a habit, prompting individuals to take action. Clear emphasizes the importance of identifying and understanding these cues, as they lay the foundation for habit formation. By recognizing the cues that trigger certain behaviors, individuals can intentionally design their environment to make desired habits more visible and accessible.

      Craving, according to Clear, is the motivational force behind every habit. He suggests that making habits inherently satisfying increases the likelihood of them becoming ingrained in one's routine. By associating positive emotions and rewards with desired behaviors, individuals can cultivate a sense of intrinsic motivation that sustains their commitment to their habits over time.

      Throughout the book, Clear offers practical strategies and techniques for implementing these principles in everyday life. He introduces concepts such as habit stacking, where new habits are built upon existing routines, and the two-minute rule, which encourages starting with small, manageable actions to overcome inertia and build momentum. Clear also explores the concept of identity-based habits, where habits are tied to one's self-image, and discusses how changing one's identity can lead to lasting habit change.
      </p>
      <p>
      In conclusion, "Atomic Habits" provides readers with a comprehensive framework for understanding and harnessing the power of habits to achieve personal and professional goals. By emphasizing the significance of small, incremental changes and providing actionable strategies for habit formation, Clear empowers individuals to cultivate habits that lead to meaningful and lasting transformations in their lives.

      At the heart of the play is the passionate love between Romeo and Juliet, which transcends the barriers of their family feud. From the moment they meet at the Capulet's masquerade ball, they are drawn to each other with an irresistible force. Their love is intense and all-consuming, expressed through Shakespeare's lyrical poetry and romantic imagery. Romeo declares,

      Response refers to the action taken in response to a cue, while reward is the ultimate outcome or benefit of a habit. Clear advocates for making responses easy and convenient to perform, as this reduces friction and increases the likelihood of habit formation. Moreover, he stresses the importance of immediate rewards to reinforce positive habits, making them more likely to stick in the long run.
